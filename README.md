# UtuThesis

This repository is dedicated to my Masters Thesis and contains a Proof-of-concept solution divided into multiple sections that attempts to automate and show possibilities of implementing FAIR risk assesment with a BBN Model to improve risk prioritization. Data is gathered by open source MISP.  

Moreover, further improvements to the model could be done by utilizing Hibernate/JPA and I will upload examples of this in the future, including full utilization of the MySQL generated variables that I developed with MySQL. Similarly further abstraction and inheretence could be implemented but due to lack of time and for simple illustration this first version keeps it simple.
