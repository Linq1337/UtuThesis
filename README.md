# UtuThesis
This repository is dedicated to my Masters Thesis and contains a Proof-of-concept solution that attempts to automate and implement FAIR risk assesment with a BBN Model to improve risk prioritization. Data is gathered by open source MISP.  

Moreover, further improvements to the model could be done by utilizing Hibernate/JPA and I will upload examples of this in the future, including full utilization of the MySQL generated variables that I developed with MySQL.
